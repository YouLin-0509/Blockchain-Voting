# Development Notes for Blockchain E-Voting DApp

## Current Project Status

This DApp is currently in a **partially developed state**. The frontend UI (React with `wagmi` for wallet connection) has been built with components for:
*   Wallet Connection (ConnectKit)
*   Voter Registration
*   Voting
*   Admin Panel (closing registration, dispatching MPC, publishing results)

**Crucially, the backend smart contracts (`ManagementContract.sol` and `CountingContract.sol`) are NOT compiled or deployed, and the frontend is currently interacting with a MOCKED backend.**

## Mocked Backend Implementation

Due to persistent issues within the development sandbox environment (see below), the Solidity smart contracts could not be compiled. To allow for continued frontend development and UI/UX testing, a mock blockchain environment was implemented:

*   **Location:** `frontend/src/contexts/MockBlockchainContext.jsx`
*   **Functionality:** This React Context simulates the behavior of the `ManagementContract` and `CountingContract`. It manages a JavaScript object (`initialBlockchainState`) that mimics the blockchain's state and provides JavaScript functions that simulate the smart contract methods.
*   **UI Integration:** The React components in `frontend/src/components/` have been updated to use this mock context via the `useMockBlockchain` hook instead of `wagmi`'s contract interaction hooks (`useContractWrite`, `useContractRead`).

## Unresolved Environment Issues (Sandbox Specific)

The primary blocker encountered during development in the provided sandbox was the inability to compile Solidity smart contracts using Hardhat.
*   **Symptom:** `npm install` (even after clean installs with `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`) failed to correctly create the necessary executable symlinks in `node_modules/.bin/`. Specifically, `node_modules/.bin/hardhat` was missing.
*   **Consequence:** `npx hardhat compile` consistently failed with `Error HH12: Trying to use a non-local installation of Hardhat...`.
*   **Attempts to fix:** Multiple clean installs, verification of `hardhat.config.js`, Node.js/npm versions, and testing with a default Hardhat project all pointed to a fundamental issue with how `npm` operates within the sandbox environment provided for this task.

This environmental issue prevented:
*   Compilation of contracts.
*   Generation of ABIs.
*   Deployment of contracts.
*   Running of Solidity unit tests using Hardhat.

## Next Steps for Full Implementation (Integrating Real Contracts)

To connect this DApp to actual Ethereum smart contracts, the following steps will be necessary:

1.  **Resolve Environment Issues:** Set up the project in a standard local development environment where Node.js, npm, and Hardhat function correctly.
2.  **Compile Contracts:**
    *   Navigate to the project root.
    *   Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
    *   Run `npx hardhat compile`. This should generate ABI files in the `artifacts/contracts/` directory.
3.  **Deploy Contracts:**
    *   Write or update deployment scripts in the `scripts/` directory (e.g., `deploy.js`).
    *   Deploy the `ManagementContract` and `CountingContract` to a local Hardhat node, a testnet (e.g., Sepolia), or mainnet. Note the deployed contract addresses.
4.  **Update Frontend Configuration:**
    *   **ABIs:** Copy the generated ABI JSON files (e.g., `ManagementContract.json`, `CountingContract.json`) into the `frontend/src/abis/` directory (create it if it doesn't exist).
    *   **Contract Addresses:** In each React component (`Registration.jsx`, `Voting.jsx`, `AdminPanel.jsx`) or a central frontend config file, replace the placeholder contract addresses (e.g., `0xYourManagementContractAddress`) with the actual deployed addresses.
5.  **Replace Mock Interactions with Wagmi Hooks:**
    *   In each component (`Registration.jsx`, `Voting.jsx`, `AdminPanel.jsx`):
        *   Remove the usage of `useMockBlockchain()`.
        *   Uncomment and configure `wagmi` hooks like `useContractWrite`, `usePrepareContractWrite`, and `useContractRead` (or their newer equivalents if `wagmi` has updated).
        *   Pass the imported ABIs and correct contract addresses to these hooks.
        *   Ensure the arguments passed to `write` or `read` functions match the smart contract function signatures.
6.  **Testing:**
    *   Thoroughly test all DApp functionalities on the chosen network.
    *   Run the Hardhat unit tests (`npx hardhat test`).
